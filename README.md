# Wolfsbane
Toy rendering engine, mostly meant to test out and visualize some of my other projects, both Vertexify and Straal are used for model loading and linear algebra, respectively.

## Plans:
* Easy to use API to render other things
* Various Shading Models (Phong, Flat, PBR)
* Cubemap Shadows
